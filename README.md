# Impreza Child Theme

## Introduction

This is a child theme for the Impreza WordPress theme. Child themes allow you to make customizations to your WordPress site while still maintaining the ability to receive updates for the parent theme.

## Features

- Built on top of the Impreza parent theme.
- Customizable styles, templates, and functions.
- Preserves the core functionality of the parent theme.

## Installation

1. **Download:** Clone this repository or [download the ZIP file](link-to-zip).
2. **Install:** Upload the child theme folder to your WordPress themes directory (`wp-content/themes/`).
3. **Activate:** Go to your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to "Appearance" > "Themes," and activate the Impreza Child Theme.

## Usage

The Impreza Child Theme inherits most of its functionality from the Impreza parent theme. To make customizations, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory within the child theme for your customizations (e.g., `custom-css` or `templates`).
2. Copy the files you want to customize from the parent theme into your child theme directory.
3. Modify the copied files as needed.

For example, to customize the CSS, copy the `style.css` file from the parent theme into your child theme's directory and make your CSS changes there.

## Customization

You can add custom CSS, JavaScript, and functions to the child theme to modify the site's appearance and behavior. Here's how:

- **Custom CSS:** Add your custom CSS to the `style.css` file in the child theme's root directory.
- **Custom JavaScript:** Add your JavaScript files to the `js` folder and enqueue them in the `functions.php` file.
- **Custom Functions:** Create a `functions.php` file in your child theme directory and add your custom PHP functions there.

## Child Theme Updates

While the child theme inherits most of its functionality from the parent theme, it's essential to keep both the parent theme and child theme up to date. When there are updates for the Impreza parent theme, make sure to:

1. Update the parent theme first.
2. Test your child theme to ensure it's still functioning correctly.
3. If necessary, update your child theme to accommodate any changes in the parent theme.
